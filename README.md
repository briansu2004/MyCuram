## Curam Social Program Management Platform

Cúram Social Program Management Platform is a business and technology solution that delivers prebuilt health and social program components, business processes, tool sets, and interfaces on top of a dynamically configurable architecture.

Cúram Social Program Management Platform helps health and social program organizations to provide optimal outcomes for citizens, satisfy increasing demand, and lower costs for organizations.

## Curam Data Extractor

Determinations data stores the display rules data that the caseworker application then uses to present and explain eligibility outcomes to caseworkers. Determinations data is also used for eligibility and entitlement reports. Determinations data is stored in a compressed format in the Social Program Management database, which makes it difficult to extract for use in reports. However, the IBM Social Program Management Data Extractor makes it easier to retrieve the display rule attributes of a product
rule set from the Determinations data.

## IBM Universal Access Responsive Web Application 4.1.1 for IBM Cúram Social Program Management 8.0.1

Responsive Web Application client uses modern technologies, such as React JavaScript, and the IBM Social Program Management Design System to enable citizens to better access services in a browser from desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### Lightweight development environment

The lightweight development environment replaces the Social Program Management application with
a Node.js hosted mock server. This accelerates set up and development, but can't fully replicate
integration testing with the Social Program Management application. Use this environment to get
started quickly.

1. Install the IBM Universal Access Responsive Web Application React development environment.

2. Configure the IBM Universal Access Responsive Web Application to connect to the mock server.

### Full development environment

In the full development environment, you install the Social Program Management Java development environment to develop and test your APIs instead of using mock APIs.

1. Install the IBM Universal Access Responsive Web Application React development environment.

2. Install the IBM Cúram Social Program Management Platform.

3. Install the IBM Cúram Universal Access Application Module.

4. Install any additional SPM components that you need:

   - To use SPM Appeals, install IBM Cúram Appeals Application Module.

   - To use SPM Verifications, IBM Cúram Verification Engine Application Module.

5. Configure the REST APIs.
